## About The Project

Our project brings **Apple's groundbreaking multimodal large language model (MLLM), Ferret**, to life on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Spaces. Developed in collaboration between Apple and Cornell University researchers, Ferret represents a **significant leap** in AI's ability to engage with and understand visual content at an unprecedented granularity. Leveraging a **hybrid region representation and a spatial-aware visual sampler**, Ferret excels at fine-grained referring and grounding tasks, making it possible to refer to and **ground anything, anywhere in an image**, with any form of referring expression.

By deploying Ferret, we aim to **explore and demonstrate its unique capabilities** in creating more nuanced and contextually rich interactions between AI and visual content. This includes **identifying objects**, **understanding relationships within images**, and **grounding textual concepts to specific visual elements**. Our implementation on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Spaces allows users to interact with Ferret in real-time, providing a tangible demonstration of its potential to revolutionize how AI perceives and discusses visual information.

### Key Features of Our Project:

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can directly interact with Ferret through a Gradio-based web interface, enabling instant visual and textual dialogues.
- **Demonstration of Advanced AI**: Showcases Ferret's hybrid approach to visual and textual data processing, blending computer vision and natural language processing for enriched multimodal communication.
- **Accessibility**: By hosting Ferret on Hugging Face Spaces, we provide easy access to this advanced technology, fostering broader experimentation and understanding within the AI community.
- **Educational Tool**: Acts as a resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to study and understand the intricacies of multimodal AI systems, particularly in referring and grounding tasks.

## Technical Details

This section outlines the key technical aspects of our Ferret deployment, including the generation of model weights, model foundations, and the hardware requirements for using the current weight configurations.

### Generation of Weights and Storage
- **Weight Generation**: We followed Apple's guidelines to generate Ferret's weights, involving the application of delta weights to Vicuna's base weights to produce the final model. This process ensures that Ferret inherits Vicuna's robust linguistic capabilities while integrating its own advanced visual understanding.
- **Storage Location**: The generated model weights are hosted on Hugging Face at [FuturePrompters/apples-ferret](https://huggingface.co/FuturePrompters/apples-ferret), ensuring easy access for deployment and experimentation.
- **Reproduce**: In order to reproduce the weights manually, one may [use script](https://huggingface.co/FuturePrompters/apples-ferret/blob/main/ferret-7b-v1-3/reproduce.sh) prepared for this occassion.

### Model Foundations
Ferret is built upon the LLaVA v.1.3 framework, leveraging Vicuna v.1.3 for its linguistic processing. This foundation provides Ferret with a sophisticated understanding of language, combined with its unique visual comprehension capabilities. It's important to note that the model, as configured, requires a GPU to run effectively due to the computational demands of processing multimodal data.

## Local Deployment

Our deployment of Ferret has been dockerized to streamline the setup process and ensure consistency across different environments. Below are the details on how to deploy Ferret locally, the processes it initiates, and how to interact with the Gradio-based UI.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the local deployment of Ferret, it's essential to ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

**Docker**: Docker must be installed and running on your machine. Docker is used to containerize the Ferret environment, ensuring that it can be deployed consistently across any platform. If you haven't installed Docker yet, visit the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions tailored to your operating system.

Having Docker installed is crucial for the deployment process, as it encapsulates the Ferret application and its dependencies within a container, simplifying the setup and execution steps. This approach also isolates the Ferret environment from your system, minimizing potential conflicts with existing software or dependencies.

**GPU**: To load the model into the GPU, **approximately 13.5GB of VRAM is required**. This is a crucial consideration for deploying Ferret, as the intensive computational tasks performed by the model necessitate significant memory bandwidth and capacity.

### Dockerized Deployment
To deploy Ferret locally, utilize the following Docker commands. These steps will prepare your environment for running Ferret:
- Build the image
  ```bash
  docker build -t ferret .
  ```
- Run the image with exposure of Gradio's port
  ```bash
  docker run ferret -p 7860:7860
  ```
- Access the Gradio based UI via Web Browser - http://0.0.0.0:7860/

### Underlying Processes
When the `app.py` entrypoint is being run, three main processes are initiated:
1. **Controller Thread**: Starts a controller that listens on port 10000, managing the overall application flow.
2. **Gradio Web Server Thread**: Launches a Gradio web server, enabling the interactive UI for user interactions.
3. **Model Worker Thread**: Begins a model worker process that handles inference tasks. This worker loads the Ferret model and performs the computational processing necessary for responding to user queries.

Each process operates in its own thread, ensuring efficient management of tasks and smooth user experience.

### Accessing the Gradio-based UI
Once the Docker container is up and running, and the processes outlined above are initiated, you can access Ferret's interactive UI through the Gradio web interface. This interface allows users to interact with Ferret in real-time, engaging in visual and textual dialogues. The Gradio-based UI is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to explore Ferret's capabilities by uploading images and posing questions or commands related to the visual content.

Usually, the Gradio UI should be accessible via http://0.0.0.0:7860/

By following these guidelines, you can effectively deploy Ferret within a local environment, leveraging its advanced multimodal conversational features through a user-friendly interface.
